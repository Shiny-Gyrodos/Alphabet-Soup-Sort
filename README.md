This is a work-in-progress string sorting algorithm. 

Words are divided into characters, which are then assigned a value based on the character it is (e. a = 0, h = 8). 
All the character values are then added up to represent the word value, then the word is sorted based on it's value, with lower values being on the
left, and higher values on the right (e. 0, 3, 12, 16, 17, 52).

This algorithm has no practical uses (that I could think of), and is just for fun and learning purposes.
